**Hi, I'm Nathan.** I am a technology evangelist who specializes in API development. I work at [Lasso MD](https://lassomd.com) as a Staff Engineer. We're focused on building the next evolution of marketing enablement software for dental practices!

As a leader, I enjoy building team cultures that support growth, inclusivity, and creativity. As an engineer, I love increasing operational efficiency through the use of technology and automation.

In my spare time, I like to [build things](https://nathanenglert.com/apps) and contribute to [DEV](https://dev.to/nathanenglert). You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nathanenglert) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-englert/).
