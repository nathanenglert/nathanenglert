        <p>
          Nathan Englert (b. 1989) is an engineer, poet, and author who explores
          near-future worlds through a cyberpunk lens. His work is influenced by
          the visual storytelling of Simon St√•lenhag, the artistic brilliance of
          Yoji Shinkawa, and the narrative depth of Hideo Kojima.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an engineer, he is passionate about building technology that
          enhances everyday life. His poetry delves into themes of mental
          health, LGBTQ+ identity, and social justice, using verse to navigate
          personal and collective struggles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether through fiction, poetry, or innovation, he is driven by a
          desire to explore the intersection of humanity and technology.
